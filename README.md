# Sales Performance Analysis and Inventory Planning in Bike Retail

# Introduction

In today’s competitive retail environment, ensuring that the right products are available at the right place and time is critical for sustaining **business growth and customer satisfaction**. This project addresses a major challenge faced by a bike retail chain: stagnant revenue growth despite increasing foot traffic and an expanding store network. The core issue lies in the imbalance between inventory distribution and customer demand across different regions. High-value bikes, which have low demand, are overstocked and remain unsold, while lower-priced, high-demand models frequently run out of stock. This mismatch has resulted in lost sales opportunities and declining profitability.
These inefficiencies in inventory and demand management underscore the need for a strategic, data-driven solution. As a data analyst, the objective is to identify sales bottlenecks, understand customer buying patterns by region, and propose actionable strategies to align inventory levels with actual market demand. The analysis includes evaluating store performance, monitoring product movement, and studying regional trends to guide better stock allocation and store management decisions.
Ultimately, this project seeks to optimize inventory planning, improve staff allocation, and enhance overall operational efficiency. By aligning supply with demand, the retail chain can boost revenue, reduce losses due to poor planning, and deliver a more satisfying customer experience.

# Dataset Overview 

This project is based on nine datasets that comprehensively represent various aspects of the bike retail business, such as orders, sales, inventory, and staffing. The data includes detailed information on bike brands, product categories, individual products, store locations, stock levels, customer orders, customer profiles, and store staff. With over **1,000 sales records** of bikes  divided into brand ,category and product the datasets offer a complete overview of operations. This well-structured data allows for in-depth analysis of sales trends, demand-supply gaps, customer behavior, and store performance, enabling the identification of inefficiencies and the development of strategic business improvements.

# Project Overview 

**Business Problem**

Despite increasing foot traffic and expanding store presence, the bike retail chain is experiencing stagnation in revenue growth and inconsistencies in product availability across locations. The management suspects that demand is not being met effectively due to suboptimal inventory distribution and misalignment between regional customer preferences and stocked products. Additionally, high-value products often sit unsold while lower-margin items sell out quickly, creating revenue leakage.
As a data analyst, your mission is to identify sales bottlenecks, understand customer demand patterns by region, and optimize inventory and staffing strategies across stores to improve profitability, reduce lost sales, and enhance customer satisfaction.
