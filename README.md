# Sales Performance Analysis and Inventory Planning in Bike Retail

# Introduction

In today’s competitive retail environment, ensuring that the right products are available at the right place and time is critical for sustaining **business growth and customer satisfaction**. This project addresses a major challenge faced by a bike retail chain: stagnant revenue growth despite increasing foot traffic and an expanding store network. The core issue lies in the imbalance between inventory distribution and customer demand across different regions. High-value bikes, which have low demand, are overstocked and remain unsold, while lower-priced, high-demand models frequently run out of stock. This mismatch has resulted in lost sales opportunities and declining profitability.
These inefficiencies in inventory and demand management underscore the need for a strategic, data-driven solution. As a data analyst, the objective is to identify sales bottlenecks, understand customer buying patterns by region, and propose actionable strategies to align inventory levels with actual market demand. The analysis includes evaluating store performance, monitoring product movement, and studying regional trends to guide better stock allocation and store management decisions.
Ultimately, this project seeks to optimize inventory planning, improve staff allocation, and enhance overall operational efficiency. By aligning supply with demand, the retail chain can boost revenue, reduce losses due to poor planning, and deliver a more satisfying customer experience.

# Dataset Overview 

This project is based on nine datasets that comprehensively represent various aspects of the bike retail business, such as orders, sales, inventory, and staffing. The data includes detailed information on bike brands, product categories, individual products, store locations, stock levels, customer orders, customer profiles, and store staff. With over **1,000 sales records** of bikes  divided into brand ,category and product the datasets offer a complete overview of operations. This well-structured data allows for in-depth analysis of sales trends, demand-supply gaps, customer behavior, and store performance, enabling the identification of inefficiencies and the development of strategic business improvements.

# Project Overview 

**Business Problem**

Despite increasing foot traffic and expanding store presence, the bike retail chain is experiencing stagnation in revenue growth and inconsistencies in product availability across locations. The management suspects that demand is not being met effectively due to suboptimal inventory distribution and misalignment between regional customer preferences and stocked products. Additionally, high-value products often sit unsold while lower-margin items sell out quickly, creating revenue leakage.
As a data analyst, your mission is to identify sales bottlenecks, understand customer demand patterns by region, and optimize inventory and staffing strategies across stores to improve profitability, reduce lost sales, and enhance customer satisfaction.

# Analysis & Decision

**Analysis Summary**

**Revenue Decline**: The analysis revealed a significant revenue drop of approximately 70% compared to the previous year. Despite increased foot traffic and store expansion, sales volume remained stagnant.

**Price-Demand Imbalance**: High-priced bikes were consistently overstocked with minimal sales, while medium- and low-priced bikes—despite strong customer demand—were frequently understocked. This reflects poor alignment between pricing strategy and actual demand.

**Inventory Mismanagement**: A severe mismatch was observed between inventory levels and customer orders. Overstocking of low-demand products and understocking of high-demand products, like Pure Cycle, highlighted inefficiencies in inventory planning.

**Store Performance Gap**: One store generated more than double the revenue of the others, which failed to even reach 50% of its sales. This indicates ineffective regional store management and a lack of strategic planning in underperforming locations.

**Geographical Demand Variation**: Orders varied significantly across cities, with some contributing high volumes while others remained under-engaged—suggesting poor market penetration or local inventory mismatch.

**Strategic Decisions**

**Improve Inventory Planning**: Align stock levels with actual demand. Avoid overstocking low-demand brands and ensure sufficient inventory of high-demand products.

**Focus on Price Strategy**: Promote low-demand high-price products through discounts or offers. Prioritize restocking high-demand, affordable bikes to boost sales volume.

**Enhance Store Management**: Balance revenue distribution by increasing store presence in low-order cities and ensuring equal inventory support across locations.

**Customer-Centric Approach**: Implement customer segmentation, gather regular feedback, and monitor cancellations to better understand preferences and improve demand forecasting.

**Data-Driven Supply Chain**: Establish a responsive and efficient supply chain strategy guided by real-time data and regional trends to minimize gaps in the demand-supply cycle.
